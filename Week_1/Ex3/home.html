    <p><span style="color: brown;">Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</span>
        After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. 
        I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.</p>
    <p>I've started putting up a <a href="Slide1.html">slide show</a> of the
      production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site.
      If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please 
      contact me.</p>
    <p>Once again: <i style="color: brown">BRAVO!!!</i> -- Mrs. Juroszek</p>
